        <h1>My Journey Building a React To-Do List: Challenges, Solutions, and Insights</h1>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In this blog post, I'll share my journey of building a To-Do List application using React 
                and LocalStorage. This application is not your typical to-do list; it's designed to help 
                users manage their tasks in three distinct categories: work, life, and pleasure or 
                self-care. This project was an opportunity for me to expand my skills in React, using a 
                vanilla JS CRUD app I had previously built as a framework.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Why I Built the To-Do List Application</h2>
            <p>The motivation behind this project was twofold. First, I wanted to expand on a vanilla 
                JS CRUD app I had already built, this time using React. This gave me a chance to delve 
                deeper into React's capabilities and learn more about its intricacies. Second, as a coach, 
                I had always encouraged my clients to break their to-do list into three parts: work, life, and 
                pleasure or self-care. I wanted to apply this idea to a project that I could use every day, 
                creating something that would help me manage my daily tasks in a more organized and efficient way.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>How the Application Works</h2>
            <p>The To-Do List application is designed to help users manage their tasks in three 
                distinct categories: work, life, and pleasure. Items related to their profession 
                go in the work list, items related to life like grocery shopping or making a dentist
                 appointment go in the life list. Lastly, pleasure, which is anything that adds extra
                  joy to life, goes on the pleasure list. This list is vital because it often comprises 
                  the things we let go by the wayside when things get busy but are often the very things 
                  we need.</p>

            <h2>My Approach to Building the Application</h2>
            <p>I was particularly excited to play with components when 
                building this app. At first, I built it in one App.js file, 
                and although it was functional, I knew multiple components 
                would make it far easier to update and change as the 
                project grew. I originally wanted to have a separate 
                component called ClearToDos that cleared the lists but found
                 that it kept clearing the whole local storage instead of
                  just the list the button was connected to.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>A Specific Challenge: Persisting To-Do Items in LocalStorage</h3>
            <p>While building the To-Do List application, I encountered a specific challenge that became a 
                significant learning opportunity. The expectation was that items would be added to a to-do list, 
                and when the page was refreshed, the items would stay in LocalStorage and render back on the screen. 
                Only when the clear button was hit would the items be cleared from the list.</p>
            <p>However, I found that items were being added to the list and also being added to 
                LocalStorage, and the clear button was correctly clearing the LocalStorage when clicked.
                 But when I refreshed the page, the items were removed from the list, and LocalStorage 
                 was cleared.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            <p>The issue was related to how the `todos` state was updated in the `TodoList` component. 
                React batches state updates that happen during event handlers and lifecycle methods, but 
                it doesn't batch updates that happen in asynchronous callbacks. In the `useEffect` hook within 
                `useLocalStorageTodos`, the `setTodos` method was called inside a try-catch block. This resulted 
                in an unbatched state update, leading to unexpected side effects.</p>
            <pre><code>// useLocalStorageTodos.js
    ...
    const savedTodos = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('todos') || '{}');
    const [todos, setTodos] = useState(savedTodos);
    
    useEffect(() => {
      try {
        localStorage.setItem('todos', JSON.stringify(todos));
      } catch (e) {
        console.error('Failed to save todos to localStorage', e);
      }
    }, [todos]);
    
    return [todos, setTodos];
    ...
    </code></pre>
            <p>This way, the initial value of the `todos` state was immediately set to whatever was 
                currently in LocalStorage when the hook was first run, rather than being updated in a 
                `useEffect` callback. This eliminated the need for an extra render to update `todos`, 
                ensuring that the data was present even if the page was quickly refreshed.</p>
            <p>I also leveraged ChatGPT to understand more about why I needed a try-catch statement. 
                It helped me realize that while it's not inherently wrong to use a `useState` function 
                inside a try/catch block, the issue was related to when and how `setTodos` was being 
                called. This interaction with ChatGPT not only helped me solve the problem but also 
                deepened my understanding of React's lifecycle and state management.</p>

            <h2>Ways I Want to Improve the Application</h2>
            <p>I would love to build this project again in React Native. I also think it would be cool to 
                create a timer associated with each to-do list item so users can plan out their day with more 
                specificity. Meaning an item is listed with an estimate of how long it will take to complete 
                that task, then there is an alarm that goes off when that item should be done.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Building the React To-Do List application was a rewarding experience that taught me valuable 
                lessons about React, LocalStorage, and frontend development. The challenges I faced and the 
                solutions I found have enriched my understanding of these technologies and have inspired me 
                to continue exploring and learning.</p>
