                <p class="text-preview">I embarked on a journey to build a To-Do List application using 
                React and LocalStorage. The motivation behind this project was to expand on a 
                vanilla JS CRUD app I had already built, only this time using React. In this blog post, I'll share my journey of building the application 
                using React useState, useEffect, and LocalStorage. This application is not your typical to-do list; it's designed to help 
                users manage their tasks in three distinct categories: work, life, and pleasure or 
                self-care. This project was an opportunity for me to expand my skills in React, using a 
                vanilla JS CRUD app I had previously built as a framework . . .

                    ChatGPT API, motivated by my fascination with how technology, 
                    particularly AI, can impact various fields, including spirituality. I wanted to create a 
                    tool that could provide different interpretations of tarot cards every time a card is 
                    returned on the screen, offering a unique reading each time . . .

                    the future of my chosen career. But once I began using it, I discovered its potential as an educational
