        <h1>ChatGPT: The Private Tutor You Didn't Know You Needed</h1>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Meeting ChatGPT: Fear Turned to Thrill</h2>
            <p>As a budding self-taught developer, I initially felt threatened when ChatGPT was released. I had just mastered CSS and HTML, and the emergence of such a powerful AI made me question the future of my chosen career. But once I began using it, I discovered its potential as an educational tool and my fears turned into excitement.</p>

            <h2>From Tutoring Humans to Being Tutored by AI</h2>
            <p>In the past, I ran a private tutoring business that boomed during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
                Much like my students, who didn't need help specifically with math or reading, but a 
                guide to facilitate their learning, ChatGPT can be a valuable guide when learning coding.</p>
            <p>The tool proved to be invaluable for understanding JavaScript's nuances, 
                answering queries like "Why would I use a while loop instead of a for loop?", 
                "What is the difference between forEach and map?", and 
                "Why wouldn't I always use querySelector?" As I started learning React the questions changed, 
                "Explain useState to me like I'm five." or "Why is this component not connecting to this one?"
                ChatGPT became the tireless tutor I needed, always ready to handle my barrage of questions.</p>

            <h2>Charting New Territories with ChatGPT</h2>
            <p>ChatGPT is also an excellent resource when you're venturing into uncharted territories. 
                When I decided to build a Spotify API project, I used ChatGPT as my "coding specialist". 
                After explaining my project's idea, I received a comprehensive list of potential hurdles, the 
                technology I needed, and the concepts I'd have to learn. With a clean roadmap laid out I can focus
            my brain power on learning the concepts instead of hunting for answers. </p>

            <h2>Tips for Using ChatGPT as Your Tutor</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Set Up Your Tutoring Session: Start a chat named "JS Tutor" and tell ChatGPT about your current project and the problems you're facing. Make it clear that you're looking for guidance. 
                    Otherwise it will give you blanket answers to your problems, which is great in most situations but not helpful
                when learning</li>
                <li>Share Your Knowledge Base: Clearly communicate what you already know and ask what you'll need to learn to complete your project.</li>
                <li>Ask for Review, Not Code: Avoid the temptation to let ChatGPT write your code for you. Instead, ask for a review of your solutions. This will deepen your understanding and improve your coding skills.</li>
                <li>Request Lessons on Specific Topics: If you're struggling with a particular concept, ask ChatGPT to provide a lesson on it, specifying what you already understand and what you need to learn.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>ChatGPT is an invaluable resource for self-taught developers and anyone looking to 
                understand complex coding concepts. It's a tireless tutor that's always available, 
                ready to answer questions, review code, and help you become a better coder.</p>
