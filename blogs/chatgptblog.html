        <h1>ChatGPT: The Private Tutor You Didn't Know You Needed</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>Meeting ChatGPT: Fear Turned to Thrill</h2>
            <p>As a budding self-taught developer, I initially felt threatened when ChatGPT was released. I had just finished learning CSS and HTML, and the emergence of such a powerful AI made me question the future of my chosen career. Would ChatGPT make jobs in tech obsolete? But once I began using it, I discovered its potential as an educational tool and my fears turned into excitement.</p>

            <h2>From Tutoring Humans to Being Tutored by AI</h2>
            <p>In my past professional life I was an educator, so I can promise you the best way to learn is not having answers fed to you, but instead in being guided toward the solution. I set up ChatGPT to be my personal JavaScript tutor with some simple instructions. I asked it not to give me any answers, explained to it the concepts I was already familiar with, and explained to it the project/concept I was studying at the moment. Then I had one conversation I could refer back to as I went through my courses, got stuck during online tutorials, or projects.</p>
            <p>ChatGPT proved to be invaluable for understanding JavaScript and React's nuances, answering queries like "Why would I use a while loop instead of a for loop?", "What is the difference between forEach and map?", and "Why wouldn't I always use querySelector?" One of my favorite go-to questions has been "Explain {insert concept} to me like I'm five." Not only do I get adorable metaphors but new and complex concepts are far easier to grasp, especially early on</p>

            <h2>Charting New Territories with ChatGPT</h2>
            <p>ChatGPT is also an excellent resource when you're venturing into uncharted territories. When I decided to build a Spotify API project, I used ChatGPT as my "coding specialist." After explaining my project's idea, how I wanted it to look, and the languages I wanted to use, I informed ChatGPT that it was the Senior Dev. on this project. I came to it with all the questions an eager entry-level developer wants to know from their Senior, but I could ask nuanced questions day and night. Not only getting the guidance I needed, but also clarity.</p>

            <h2>Tips for Using ChatGPT as Your Tutor</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Set Up Your Tutoring Session:</strong><br><br>
                    Start a chat named "JS Tutor" and tell ChatGPT about your current project 
                    and the problems you're facing. Make it clear that you're looking for guidance. 
                    Otherwise it will give you blanket answers to your problems, which is great in most 
                    situations but not helpful when learning</li>
                <br><br>
                <li><strong>Share Your Knowledge Base:</strong><br><br> 
                    Clearly communicate, when creating the conversation, what you 
                    already know and ask what you'll need to learn to complete your project. 
                    When I didn't do this, ChatGPT would often assume I knew nothing. 
                    As a result some answers (especially ones without specific coding questions) 
                    were vague. The best way to avoid this is to let them know where you are, and 
                    the replies will be far more specific for your learning journey.</li>
                <br><br>
                <li><strong>Ask for Review, Not Code:</strong><br><br> 
                    Avoid the temptation to let ChatGPT write your code for you. 
                    Trust me this is extremely tempting especially as someone who 
                    likes getting things done efficiently, and I know the tech at my fingertips
                     could write the whole function/component for me. I wouldn't even need to 
                     understand it in some cases. However while you will get code that works, 
                     you won't learn anything. Instead, ask for a review of your code, and ask 
                     it why it isn't functioning like you expect. This will deepen your understanding 
                     of not only how to write better code, and improve your understanding about how 
                     certain concepts really work. When building my first React project I did this a 
                     lot. It was through this that I realized I was using UseState incorrectly. 
                     I read ChatGPT's feedback, then did more research into useState, and 
                     reformatted my code. I then gave chatGPT my new code for more feedback.</li>
                <br><br>
                <li><strong>Request Lessons on Specific Topics:</strong> <br><br> If you're struggling with a particular concept, ask ChatGPT to provide a lesson on it, specifying what you already understand and what you need to learn. I used this when I was first wrapping my head around the difference between a Fetch, Get, and Post API. While the course I was taking had all sorts of graphs, I still didn't understand why I would use one over the other. So I asked ChatGPT to break down the three different APIs, include examples, and explain it with lots of metaphors. The explanation was not only in-depth but a great addition to all the other sources I had gone through</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>ChatGPT is an invaluable resource for self-taught developers and anyone looking to understand complex coding concepts. It's a tireless tutor that's always available, ready to answer questions, review code, and help you become a better coder.</p>
