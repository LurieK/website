        <h1>ChatGPT: The Private Tutor You Didn't Know You Needed</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>Meeting ChatGPT: Fear Turned to Thrill</h2>
            <p>Like many, when I first heard about the power of ChatGPT, I initially felt threatened. Would the emergence of AI make jobs in tech obsolete? Was I professionally doomed? But once I began using it as a coding tool, my fears turned into excitement.</p>

            <h2>From Tutoring Humans to Being Tutored by AI</h2>
            <p>In my past professional life, I was an educator, so based on years of experience, I know the best way to learn is not to have answers fed to you but instead to be guided toward the solution. When studying new technologies, unless there is a great course online, developers are left with two options: trial and error, building something on their own, or watching tutorials that essentially hand-feed coding solutions. Yet AI offers a third option, guiding you through the concepts, which I believe changes the game.</p>

            <p>I set up ChatGPT to be my personal tech tutor with some simple instructions. I asked it not to give me any answers, explained the concepts I was already familiar with, and explained the project/concept I was studying at the moment. This prepared it to receive questions as I work on a project that doesn’t feed me solutions but instead acts as a mentor, helping me find solutions. Personally, I tend to ask lots of questions when encountering new ideas. I don’t just want to understand how to make something work but also the tech behind why it is working. One key benefit of ChatGPT is it doesn’t tire of my questions, willing to continue giving more information day and night. So if you are like me, it is the perfect tutor!</p>

            <h2>Charting New Territories with ChatGPT</h2>
            <p>ChatGPT has one flaw, however: its knowledge stops at September 2021, meaning it is unfamiliar with some new technologies (ironically, it doesn’t know about ChatGPT 4, plugins, or other updates to open.ai). Yet it can be taught. By taking the documentation of any technology and pasting it into ChatGPT, you can ask it to create a summary, clarify sections you may be confused about, and even ask it how to handle certain errors when implementing that technology. No matter how well I may feel I understand something, ChatGPT typically knows it better and quicker. Having this type of tech as a guide ready to help explain things is invaluable.</p>

            <h2>Tips for Using ChatGPT as Your Tutor</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Set Up Your Tutoring Session:</strong><br><br>
                    Start a chat named "JS Tutor" or whatever technology you are focusing on, and tell ChatGPT about your current project 
                    and the problems you're facing. Make it clear that you're looking for guidance. 
                    Otherwise, it will give you blanket answers to your problems, which is great in most 
                    situations but not helpful when learning.</li>
                <br><br>
                <li><strong>Share Your Knowledge Base:</strong><br><br> 
                    Clearly communicate, when creating the conversation, what you 
                    already know and ask what you'll need to learn to complete your project. 
                    When I didn't do this, ChatGPT would often assume I knew nothing. 
                    As a result, some answers (especially ones without specific coding questions) 
                    were vague. The best way to avoid this is to let them know where you are, and 
                    the replies will be far more specific for your learning journey.</li>
                <br><br>
                <li><strong>Ask for Review, Not Code:</strong><br><br> 
                    Avoid the temptation to let ChatGPT write your code for you. 
                    Trust me, this is extremely tempting, especially as someone who 
                    likes getting things done efficiently, and I know the tech at my fingertips
                    could write the whole function/component for me. I wouldn't even need to 
                    understand it in some cases. However, while you will get code that works, 
                    you won't learn anything. Instead, ask for a review of your code, and ask 
                    why it isn't functioning as you expect. This will deepen your understanding 
                    of not only how to write better code but improve your understanding of how 
                    certain concepts really work. When building my first React project, I did this a 
                    lot. It was through this that I realized I was using useState incorrectly. 
                    I read ChatGPT's feedback, then did more research into useState, and 
                    reformatted my code. I then gave ChatGPT my new code for more feedback.</li>
                <br><br>
                <li><strong>Request Lessons on Specific Topics:</strong> <br><br> If you're struggling with a particular concept, ask ChatGPT to provide a lesson on it, specifying what you already understand and what you need to learn. I used this when I was first wrapping my head around the difference between a Fetch, Get, and Post API. While the course I was taking had all sorts of graphs, I still didn't understand why I would use one over the other. So I asked ChatGPT to break down the three different APIs, include examples, and explain it with lots of metaphors. The explanation was not only in-depth but a great addition to all the other sources I had gone through.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>ChatGPT is an invaluable resource for developers and anyone looking to understand new concepts. It's a tireless tutor that's always available, ready to answer questions, review code, and help you become a better coder.</p>
