        <h1>My Journey Building a Tarot Card Reading Application with ChatGPT</h1>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I embarked on a journey to build a Tarot Card Reading site using the 
                ChatGPT API, motivated by my fascination with how technology, 
                particularly AI, can impact various fields, including spirituality. I wanted to create a 
                tool that could provide different interpretations of tarot cards every time a card is 
                returned on the screen, offering a unique reading each time.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Why I Built the Tarot Card Reading Application</h2>
            <p>I built this application because I was excited about how ChatGPT could understand and 
                interpret the principles of spirituality. Writing out 78 different interpretations 
                for tarot cards can be tedious, but even more it is a stagnant experince for users.  Once they read the interpretation 
            , there is no more knowledge to gain. I was thrilled about creating something 
                that gave different answers every time that were still accurate and applicable. 
                This project was an opportunity for me to explore the intersection of technology 
                and spirituality, and to provide a tool for independent exploration of ideas, free 
                from the influence of of other readers.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>How the Application Works</h2>
            <p>The application offers users two options: they can select a card from the drop-down 
                menu or let the site choose a random card via a function that uses Math.random from 
                the cards object array. The chosen card is then passed through a fetch API which 
                prompts ChatGPT to read the card and give a reading. This reading is then returned 
                to the user, providing a unique interpretation each time.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>My Approach to Building the Application</h2>
            <p>I built this application off of a very simple vanilla JS function. I originally used an 
                if/else statement, then updated it to a switch. However, after updating the program to 
                make it modular, I also wanted to simplify the code so I changed the switch to findIndex.
                This not only looks much cleaner, but is far easier to update.  Previously when I wanted to 
                adjust the information in the object array containing the cards names, I needed to update the object 
                as well as the switch.  Now I only need to update the object.

            <h3>Challenges I Faced</h3>
            <p>Building something with an API was a new experience for me, and it was exciting to explore all
                 the possibilities an API presents. Particularly with ChatGPT, writing the right prompt is 
                 key to getting the API to return what I want, and I had to try multople different versions of prompts
                  before I got card interpretations that worked for the site.  </p>
            <p>I also learned a lot about protecting data and how essential an .env file is with APIs. Initially the api 
                was available for anyone to read on github.  Going back to hide it was a long process that also stretched my
                skills around creating new branches, merging branches, and cloning repos. 
                </p>
            <p>Another challenge I experienced was an issue with designing the CSS for the 
                cards and the response without having to log a new card every time to see if the css worked.
                 To solve this, I added a dummy description and card to the HTML, designed the layout, and then 
                applied it to the CSS for the description and card return.</p>

            <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
            <p>The next level for this project is in creating a backend. I want to add a journal 
                aspect to this site which will be connected to each user. Users can log in and save 
                their thoughts and the daily readings. I also want to add a prompt to the site, so 
                users can put in a certain situation they are looking for answers to and get responses 
                related to a specific question. </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Building the Tarot Card Reading application was a rewarding experience that taught 
                me valuable lessons about APIs, data protection, and frontend development. 
                The challenges I faced and the solutions I found have enriched my understanding of 
                these technologies and have inspired me to continue exploring and learning.</p>
