        <h1>My Journey Building a Tarot Card Reading Application with ChatGPT</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Beginning the journey of building a Tarot Card Reading site using the
                ChatGPT API, I was motivated by my fascination with how technology,
                particularly AI, can impact various fields, including spirituality. I wanted to create a
                tool that could provide different interpretations of tarot cards every time a card is
                returned on the screen, offering a unique reading each time.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Why I Built the Tarot Card Reading Application</h2>
            <p>I built this application because I was excited about how ChatGPT could understand and
                interpret the principles of spirituality. Writing out 78 different interpretations
                for tarot cards can be tedious, but even more, it is a stagnant experience for users. Once they read the
                interpretation, there is no more knowledge to gain. I was thrilled about creating something
                that was accurate and applicable that also gave different interpretations every time.
                This project was an opportunity for me to explore the intersection of technology
                and spirituality, and to provide a tool for independent exploration of ideas, free
                from the influence of other tarot readers.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>How the Application Works</h2>
            <p>The application offers users two options: they can select a card from the drop-down
                menu or let the site choose a random card via a function using Math.random from
                the cards object array. The chosen card is then passed through a fetch API which
                prompts ChatGPT to read the card and return an interpretation. This reading is then returned
                to the user, providing a unique reading each time a card is selected.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>My Approach to Building the Application</h2>
            <p>I built this application off of a very simple vanilla JS function. I originally used an
                if/else statement, then updated it to a switch. However, after updating the program to
                make it modular, I also wanted to simplify the code so I changed the switch to findIndex.
                This not only looks much cleaner, but is far easier to update. Previously when I wanted to
                adjust the information in the object array containing the cards' names, I needed to update the object
                as well as the switch. Now I only need to update the object, and findIndex takes care of the rest.

            <h3>Challenges I Faced</h3>
            <p>Building something with an API is one thing and comes with its own challenges. However, writing one with
                ChatGPT also means writing the right prompt so the API will return exactly what I want and not
                hallucinate. Meaning, I had to try multiple different versions of prompts
                before I got the type of card interpretations that were correct and worked for the site. My primary
                technique when engineering prompts is to write like I am talking to a very smart five-year-old. Making sure my question
                is as specific as possible, and doesn't leave room for the AI to return answers unrelated to the topic, or made up.</p>
            <p> This project also presented me with a great opportunity to utilize backend frameworks: Express and CORS.
                By building a small backend with the Express framework, I was able to set up routes, handle HTTP
                requests, and manage the server-side logic. The integration of CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) was
                set up to ensure security measures and enable cross-origin requests. This allowed me to ensure
                communication between the frontend and backend without revealing my API key.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
            <p>The next level for this project is in creating a more robust backend. I want to add a journal
                aspect to this site which will be password protected and stored for each user. Users can log in and save
                their thoughts about their daily readings. I also want to add a prompt section to the site, allowing
                users to put in a specific question they are looking for answers to, so the responses
                are related to a specific situation.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Building the Tarot Card Reading application was an opportunity to merge two interests and explore a
                little bit of backend development.
                I am excited to continue to grow this project and create something people can use daily to enhance their
                life.</p>
