        <h1>Learning to Code: What I found most useful and what I would do differently</h1>

        <section>
            <p>Learning a new programming language or framework can be daunting, especially when so many resources are available online. How do you choose the right path? How do you navigate the sea of tutorials, courses, and videos? In my journey to learn React, I've explored various platforms and resources, each with strengths and weaknesses. In this blog post, I'll share my experiences with Codecademy and Scrimba, two popular learning platforms, and provide insights into what I found most helpful and less helpful. Whether you're a seasoned developer looking to expand your skillset or a beginner starting from scratch, I hope my reflections will guide your learning journey.</p>

            <h2>Codecademy vs. Scrimba</h2>
            <h4>Codecademy (the pluses)</h4>
            <div class="CA-log-container">
                <img class=CA-logo src="../img/codecademy-banner.png">
                <p>A lot to love about Codecademy: their CSS and HTML courses are excellent! Everything was explained clearly, and I built usable landing pages within a few weeks. Some people say they struggle with CSS, but I give Codecademy credit for why I feel very comfortable in CSS land.</p>
            </div>
            <h4>Codecademy (the minuses)</h4>
            <p>I don’t know if it is related to the nature of CSS and HTML vs. JavaScript, but I didn’t enjoy their JS or React courses as much. My biggest issue was their lessons on these topics weren't always consistent. Teaching styles vary from lesson to lesson, switching from actively coding right away to just watching a video or reading an article. Other times, I was thrown into the deep end, working with complex concepts solo that were barely covered. Other lessons still focused a half hour on ideas that could be summarized in a paragraph.</p>
            <h4>Supplemental resources</h4>
            <p>My struggles with Codecademy led me to find supplemental resources that got me through my learning struggles. I completed the JavaScript 1 and JavaScript 2 courses with them and also relied on the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a> - Especially their YouTube lessons</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@programmingwithmosh">Programming with Mosh</a> - His YouTube channel broke down a ton of concepts in ways that were easier to process.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SamMeechWard">Sam Meech-Ward</a> - He has an entire React.Js playlist on his YouTube that I highly recommend if you are stuck with anything like Components, useState, or Props.</li>
                <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a> - Especially learning different JS methods.</li>
                <li><a href="https://leetcode.com/">leetCode</a> - I ran challenges and practiced, practiced, practiced.</li>
                <li><a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a> - I already wrote about how helpful ChatGPT has been as a Frontend Tutor (<a href="https://luriekimmerledev.com/blogs/chatgptblog.html">link</a>). Please note sometimes ChatGPT is wrong, so while I still use it a lot, it is always best to read its responses with a grain of salt.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I will also echo what thousands of other developers have said: learning happens from doing. Nothing beats just opening VS code and creating something that has been on my mind. Inevitably I run into issues, and that is when the learning starts.</p>
            <h3>Scrimba</h3>
            <p>I'll be fully transparent; learning React has been challenging, and while I had React projects under my belt for a while, I still felt uncomfortable in React land. After listening to the Scrimba podcast, I decided to try their free course.</p>
            <h4>Scrimba (pluses)</h4>
            <p>The man who teaches this course, Bob Ziroll, is a great teacher. As a teacher myself, it is an art to know when to hold a student's hands and when to let them figure things out on their own. Bob fully understands this. While most of the content was a refresher, things like props, which still felt mystical to me, made much more sense after his lesson.</p>
            <p>I am still working through the whole course, but I just signed up because he also teaches the Advanced React course, which is part of the membership, and I want to take it next.</p>
            <h4>Scrimba (minuses)</h4>
            <p>To access the projects connected with the Scrimba free course, you must sign up for a Pro membership. You can sign up monthly but save a ton if you commit to a more extended subscription. This isn’t a real negative, but if you are looking for something 100% free, just know there are a few lessons only available to paid members.</p>
