            This is a little bit about me. This is a sentance about how I can help you. This is more about me. I am a softward developer (JavaScript, REACT, HTML, CSS) who loves using to tech to solve problems. 
            I began learning programing six months ago, and since then have built over 20 projects (this might not be exact I'll have to count)
            and recently started studying python and AI.
